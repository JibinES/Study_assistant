# ✅ Fixed: Save Image First, Then Add to PDF

## 🔧 What Changed

### **New Approach: File-Based (Reliable)**

```python
# Track temp file path for later cleanup
temp_img_path = None

if mindmap_image:
    # 1. Save PNG bytes to temp file (delete=False keeps it)
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.png', delete=False) as tmp_img:
        tmp_img.write(mindmap_image)
        temp_img_path = tmp_img.name  # Store path
    
    # 2. Create Image using file path (ReportLab-friendly)
    img = Image(temp_img_path, width=450, height=300, kind='proportional')
    elements.append(img)

# 3. Build PDF (reads image from file)
doc.build(elements)

# 4. Clean up temp file AFTER PDF is built
if temp_img_path and os.path.exists(temp_img_path):
    os.unlink(temp_img_path)
```

## 🎯 Key Differences

### **Before (Broken):**
```
Save → Delete → Try to read deleted file ❌
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
Save → Build PDF (reads file) → Delete ✅
```

## ✅ Why This Works

1. **`delete=False`** - Temp file persists after context manager closes
2. **File path stored** - Saved in `temp_img_path` variable
3. **PDF built** - ReportLab reads the existing file
4. **Cleanup after** - File deleted only after `doc.build()` completes

## 📊 Flow

```
Playwright generates PNG bytes
         ↓
Write to temp file (/var/folders/.../tmpXXX.png)
         ↓
Store file path (temp_img_path)
         ↓
Create Image(temp_img_path)
         ↓
Add to elements list
         ↓
doc.build(elements) ← Reads file here
         ↓
os.unlink(temp_img_path) ← Delete NOW (safe!)
         ↓
Return PDF bytes
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test

**Restart Flask server:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C
python3 app.py
```

**Test:**
1. Generate study material
2. Click "📥 Download PDF"
3. **Mind map image will be in the PDF!** 🎨

The PDF should now generate successfully with the mind map as a PNG image on the last page!
